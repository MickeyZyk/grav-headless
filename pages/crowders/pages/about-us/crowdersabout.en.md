She is a care taker, a we first-you second-me last team player, a selfless motivator, a pusher and puller, based on what people need or what makes them stronger in their roles.\r\nTurned corporate cultures into belonging emplying her natural gift and talent of a family creator, a herdsgirl, a flocker, a crowd carer, a swarm guard, caring how people feel, what they need, how can she help.\r\n\r\nA median mix of European North and South, whatever job position in business she started, she has always ended organizing - the North talent - people - the South talent. She formed them into teams and further even into one family, with a purpose and a sense of belonging.\r\n\r\nShe holds several positions, all having to do with running the family. A pretty big family with over tens of thousands of siblings, relatives, connected family members. All having to feel as a part. All having a different role, personality, talent and gift. All contributing differently, at different times, at different tasks."
