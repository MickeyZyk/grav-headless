paragraph_one: 'A safe place where those who are searching for the great idea meet with the ones that have them. And where they have access not just to one amazing idea, but to several of them. A place, where the idea creators – who we call BAKERS get rewarded if their idea is selected by the client. We are a constantly growing group of bakers and creative thinkers. We believe it is important to provide a space for ideas and wonderful creations. We want to give everybody a chance to contribute. We believe the more idea makers we have, the more we can all move forward.'
subheading_two: 'We are a group of enthusiasts and passionate thinkers'

paragraph_two: 'We believe that a great idea can pop up anywhere: in a bar, during a wonderfully peaceful weekend, while running, before going to bed, while chatting with your loved one, from a student, retiree or stay-at-home mom or dad.'

        member_text: "For past 30 years I have worked with the owners and leaders of successful companies across the whole world. Even with politicians and country leaders.\r\nI help them with strategic marketing and communication.\r\nFor many years I was connected with BBDO Worldwide agency network. I worked in BBDO Toronto and lead Prague office which stood behind great creative and business projects in the Czech Republic and CEE region. I found and helped unlock hundreds of talents.\r\nAll this helped me see even more clearly that the crowd can do more that “the above”.\r\nThat’s why Robert Peňažka and I have built Future Bakery platform. For everybody to participate, for us to listen better and for things to work better."

        member_text: "Imagine you have a family with thousands of relatives.\r\nThis is exactly the family Alena takes care of. Future Bakery family comprising of twenty five thousands people from the crowd. People with great energy and ideas.\r\nWe know very well that none of us is as smart as we all together. Also, that we are all creative. It’s enough to give impulse and it rolls off. This world is full of creativity, fresh and - for somebody - weird ideas and insights. Our work is to work well with this and give it all a life."

        text: "Díky Vám jsem našel i směr, když to řeknu nadneseně - smysl pracovního života.\_😁\_Protože jsem pořád nevěděl, co by mě bavilo a pak jste přišli Vy a naučili jste mě svobodně, a kolikrát bezhlavě, psát nesmysly, které i sem tam někoho zaujmou. Takže ač jsem dodělal IT školu, tak stejně jsem se vrhl do online marketingu, kde jsem se našel. Teď si plně spravuji firemní e-shop a řeším i marketingové věci kolem něj a to je přesně to, kam jsem došel jenom díky FutureBakery. Předtím by mě to nikdy nenapadlo, ani bych se o tohle odvětví nezajímal, protože bych ho prostě neznal. "

        text: "”It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).”\_"
