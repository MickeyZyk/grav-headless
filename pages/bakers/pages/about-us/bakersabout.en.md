paragraph_one: 'A safe place where those who are searching for the great idea meet with the ones that have them. And where they have access not just to one amazing idea, but to several of them. A place, where the idea creators – who we call BAKERS get rewarded if their idea is selected by the client. We are a constantly growing group of bakers and creative thinkers. We believe it is important to provide a space for ideas and wonderful creations. We want to give everybody a chance to contribute. We believe the more idea makers we have, the more we can all move forward.'
subheading_two: 'We are a group of enthusiasts and passionate thinkers'

paragraph_two: 'We believe that a great idea can pop up anywhere: in a bar, during a wonderfully peaceful weekend, while running, before going to bed, while chatting with your loved one, from a student, retiree or stay-at-home mom or dad.'

        member_text: "For past 30 years I have worked with the owners and leaders of successful companies across the whole world. Even with politicians and country leaders.\r\nI help them with strategic marketing and communication.\r\nFor many years I was connected with BBDO Worldwide agency network. I worked in BBDO Toronto and lead Prague office which stood behind great creative and business projects in the Czech Republic and CEE region. I found and helped unlock hundreds of talents.\r\nAll this helped me see even more clearly that the crowd can do more that “the above”.\r\nThat’s why Robert Peňažka and I have built Future Bakery platform. For everybody to participate, for us to listen better and for things to work better."

Future Bakery family comprising of twenty five thousands people from the crowd. People with great energy and ideas.\r\nWe know very well that none of us is as smart as we all together. Also, that we are all creative. It’s enough to give impulse and it rolls off. This world is full of creativity, fresh and - for somebody - weird ideas and insights. Our work is to work well with this and give it all a life."

        name: 'Ondra Bolvári'
        text: 'Thanks to you I’ve found a direction or, actually a sense of my life. Because I did not know for long what I might be interested in… and then you came and taught me to freely put my ideas on paper and surprisingly, they caught someone’s attention. So even though I graduated from IT school, I plunged myself into online marketing where I found myself. Now I manage my e-shop and do the marketing around and this is where I got purely thanks to Future Bakery. It would never come to my mind to be interested in that sphere because I did not now it then.'

        text: 'The challenge, the drive, the possibility to achieve something and check I can do it (or not). The possibility to spin my brain into full speed (?) and, moreover, the chance to get a reward. Thanks to you I can experience an interesting state of mind and a lot of emotions: curiosity, sometimes reluctance, but most of the time enthusiasm when I read a new project brief. Then comes an intensive thinking, creativity, idea check and the joy that I managed to accomplish the work. And the best about it is when I finally win, then I am overwhelmed by extreme happiness.'

        text: 'When I discovered you, I was really overwhelmed. Wooow. Finally there is something new and really creative for all of us. It doesn’t matter if you are a student, designer, a shop assistant or a lawyer. Each one of us can in this country can co-create. For me this is great. In my leisure time I can go to Future Bakery pages, release my fantasy and relax from everyday routine. At the same time, there is a healthy competition and excitement whether my idea is the right one. I simply feel to be a part of a great team.'

        text: 'Future Bakery primarily means a new experience for me. It proved to me that everybody can succeed (if they are not discouraged by not winning immediately). The portfolio of Clients is really wide. Coming up with ideas is both fun and challenge as I do not work in this branch.'

        text: 'Future Bakery provides a possibility to create. There is a lot of techniques and mobile applications for improving your creativity, but your page offers real projects from real life and provides real rewards. And it’s not only about coming up with advertising campaigns. Projects like how to improve interior of a new model of Fiat to reflect a real need for women, or how to make use of velcro that can hold several kilograms or how to use a chip for contactless payments - it is also a technical issue.'

        text: 'Future Bakery as a strong, original story. Future Bakery is a mediator, visionary, monk, guru, teacher, master, lover, sex, wild passion as well as a game with clear rules… crime and punishment, feast and work, entertainment, euphoria as well as hard work or tears, winning and losing, lover and friend…. Future Bakery is a laboratory of positive emotions, of inner challenge, it’s an alchymist. Future Bakery is primarily a strong original positive story! Future Bakery clearly and sensitively sets cooperation rules for everybody and clarifies mutual orientation. There is no discrimination or limits to your fantasy, motivation is the main aspect which Future Bakery uses phenomenally. And there is a feedback and final evaluation.'
