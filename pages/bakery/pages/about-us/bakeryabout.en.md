        member_text: "For past 30 years I've been working with successful companies as well as entrepreneurs. With politicians and country leaders.\r\nFinding right marketing strategies and communication for their goals and businesses.\r\nFor many years I was a part of the BBDO Worldwide agency network working for BBDO Toronto and Prague offices. As CEO for Prague office I found and helped to unlock hundreds of talented people. Together with these talents we became the top creative shop in the Czech Republic and CEE region.\r\nAll this experience helped me to see even more clearly the power of the crowd. How much more we can achieve than the usual...\r\nThat’s why Robert Peňažka and I have built Future Bakery family."

        member_text: "Imagine you have a family with thousands of relatives.\r\nThis is exactly the family Alena takes care of. Future Bakery family comprising of twenty five thousands people from the crowd. People with great energy and ideas.\r\nWe know very well that none of us is as smart as we all together. Also, that we are all creative. It’s enough to give impulse and it rolls off. This world is full of creativity, fresh and - for somebody - weird ideas and insights. Our work is to work well with this and give it all a life."
