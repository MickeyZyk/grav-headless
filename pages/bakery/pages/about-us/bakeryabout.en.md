        member: 'Alena. Feels it.'
        member_text: '"How do we feel?" Alena has been empowering people throughout her business career by making them feel as a part of a big family, on a mission, with a purpose. She is a care taker, a we first-you second-me last team player, a selfless motivator, a pusher and puller, based on what people need or what makes them stronger in their roles. Turned corporate cultures into belonging emplying her natural gift and talent of a family creator, a herdsgirl, a flocker, a crowd carer, a swarm guard, caring how people feel, what they need, how can she help. A median mix of European North and South, whatever job position in business she started, she has always ended organizing - the North talent - people - the South talent. She formed them into teams and further even into one family, with a purpose and a sense of belonging. She holds several positions, all having to do with running the family. A pretty big family with over tens of thousands of siblings, relatives, connected family members. All having to feel as a part. All having a different role, personality, talent and gift. All contributing differently, at different times, at different tasks.'
