She formed them into teams and further even into one family, with a purpose and a sense of belonging.\r\n\r\nShe holds several positions, all having to do with running the family. A pretty big family with over tens of thousands of siblings, relatives, connected family members. All having to feel as a part. All having a different role, personality, talent and gift. All contributing differently, at different times, at different tasks."
